# Futurice Academy - project assignment

_This readme is part of our Futurice Academy job application process._

We want to see what you can create with technology. In your application, link to a project that you've worked on and are proud of.

If you don't have an existing project to share, don't worry. 

Here's an idea for a project that you can build to showcase your skills in your favorite tech stack:

A lot of modern development on web and mobile is built around using APIs to get, analyze and display data. GitHub's REST API offers a public interface to users, repositories and projects in GitHub. What we'd like you to do, is to build a small app that utilizes that API: it could be a portfolio-style web application to showcase user's or organization's repositories, a mobile app to follow open source project's pull requests, or a machine learning service predicting amount of contributions to a particular project, or even an interactive Power BI report with AI module and imaginative visualization.

Surprise us with your creativity but keep in mind that you donâ€™t need to create a full blown service. Pick a few interesting features and focus on the quality of the solution. You shouldn't spend more than a few hours or evenings on this.

Imagine you would need to continue developing and maintaining that application for a while and consider that other people might need to work with your code (including us as reviewers).

Choice of technologies, architecture of your solution etc. are entirely up to you. Once you are ready, please provide the source code of the application and a short explanation, e.g. in a Github repository.
